This describes the reverse engineered LED Sign Protocol.


Reverse engineering was accomplished through two mechanisms.  The first 
was to use LED Digit Board software 6.2 under VirtualBox.  The use of 
SysInternals.org PortMon application under Windows gives a byte by 
byte breakdown.  The second was to configure VirtualBox to use a file for the 
the serial device.  With that, the ProtoRead application can decode and present
the protocol stream.

It is believed that the flow control is provided by the judicious use of delays
and pauses. 


Serial Configuration works only in Serial 38400, N-8-1

All Requests start with Device Attention 0x00, followed

Generic Structure is a command up to 69 bytes.  All commands start with 0x02.
